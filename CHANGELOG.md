## [0.0.4-alpha] - 2025-11-09

### Summary

This release simplifies session identification and improves the stats tracking system.

### Changed

  - Now correctly shows "Delimiter events" (events with :hook-event field)
  - Added separate "Cljfmt events" count
  - More accurate breakdown of event types

- **Documentation updates**
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with current log file path (.clojure-mcp-light-hooks.log)
  - Note that log file is configurable via --log-file flag

[0.0.4-alpha]: https://github.com/bhauman/clojure-mcp-light/releases/tag/v0.0.4-alpha

## [0.0.3-alpha] - 2025-11-09

This version represents a major improvement in robustness and developer experience.

### Summary

* **Fixed hook response protocol** - Hooks now return `nil` for normal operations instead of explicit `permissionDecision: allow` responses. The previous approach was bypassing Claude Code's normal permission dialogs, causing the UI to not properly prompt users for confirmation.

* **Robust nREPL session persistence** - Session management now properly handles multiple concurrent Claude Code sessions running in the same directory using session-scoped temporary files with fallback strategies (env var → PPID-based → global).

* **Automatic cleanup via SessionEnd hook** - Session persistence requires temporary file storage that must be cleaned up. The new SessionEnd hook automatically removes session directories when Claude Code sessions terminate, preventing accumulation of stale temporary files.

* **cljfmt support** - The `--cljfmt` CLI option enables automatic code formatting. Claude frequently indents code incorrectly by one space, and cljfmt quickly fixes these issues. Well-formatted code is essential for parinfer's indent mode to work correctly, making this option highly recommended.

* **Debugging support** - The `--log-level` and `--log-file` CLI options provide configurable logging. Without proper logging, developing and troubleshooting clojure-mcp-light is extremely difficult.

* **Statistics tracking** - The `--stats` flag enables global tracking of delimiter events. The `scripts/stats-summary.bb` tool provides comprehensive analysis of fix rates, error patterns, and code quality metrics.

### Added
- **Statistics tracking system** - Track delimiter events to analyze LLM code quality
  - `--stats` CLI flag enables event logging to `~/.clojure-mcp-light/stats.log`
  - Event types: `:delimiter-error`, `:delimiter-fixed`, `:delimiter-fix-failed`, `:delimiter-ok`
  - Stats include timestamps, hook events, and file paths
  - `scripts/stats-summary.bb` - Comprehensive analysis tool for stats logs
  - Low-level parse error tracking and false positive filtering
  - Cljfmt efficiency tracking (already-formatted vs needed-formatting vs check-errors)

- **Unified tmp namespace** - Session-scoped temporary file management
  - Centralized temporary file paths with automatic cleanup
  - Editor session detection with fallback strategies (env var → PPID-based → global)
  - Deterministic paths based on user, hostname, session ID, and project SHA
  - Per-project isolation prevents conflicts across multiple projects
  - Functions: `session-root`, `editor-scope-id`, `cleanup-session!`, `get-possible-session-ids`

- **SessionEnd cleanup hook** - Automatic temp file cleanup
  - Removes session directories when Claude Code sessions terminate
  - Attempts cleanup for all possible session IDs (env-based and PPID-based)
  - Recursive deletion with detailed logging (attempted, deleted, errors, skipped)
  - Never blocks SessionEnd events, even on errors

- **Enhanced CLI options**
  - `--log-level LEVEL` - Explicit log level control (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, report)
  - `--log-file PATH` - Custom log file path (default: `./.clojure-mcp-light-hooks.log`)
  - `--cljfmt` - Enable automatic code formatting with cljfmt after write/edit operations

- **Comprehensive testing documentation** in CLAUDE.md

### Changed
- **Logging system** - Replaced custom logging with Timbre
  - Structured logging with timestamps, namespaces, and line numbers
  - Configurable appenders and log levels
  - Conditional ns-filter for targeted logging
  - Disabled by default to avoid breaking hook protocol

- **Hook system improvements**
  - Refactored hook response format to minimize unnecessary output
  - Updated hook tests to match new response format
  - Extracted PPID session ID logic into dedicated function
  - Flattened tmp directory structure to single session-project level

- **CLI handling** - Refactored into dedicated `handle-cli-args` function
  - Cleaner separation of concerns
  - Better error handling and help messages
  - Uses `tools.cli` for argument parsing

- **File organization** - Migrated to unified tmp namespace
  - `hook.clj` now uses tmp namespace for backups
  - `nrepl_eval.clj` now uses tmp namespace for per-target sessions
  - Consistent session-scoped file management across all components

### Removed
- **-c short flag** for `--cljfmt` option (prevented conflicts with potential future flags)
